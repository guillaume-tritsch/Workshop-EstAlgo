# I MAK'OLOR

We chose to work on **Option B**, integrating three main ideas for generating color sets:  
1. Randomly generated sets.  
2. Extracting colors from pictures using the **Picsum API**.  
3. Deriving colors from movie posters using the **OMDb API**.  

> The second palette display (gradient) does not work properly on this browser.

## Features

### Animated Background  
The homepage features an animated background that interacts with the mouse. On this page, users can:  
- Select the number of colors to generate (from 4 to 8).  
- Choose the color generation mode.  
- Read a brief explanation of our site.  

### Display Modes for Color Sets  
We implemented four unique ways to display the generated color sets:  
1. **Classic Layout**: A traditional arrangement with columns of colors.  
2. **Gradient Blur**: A creative display using randomly placed ellipses of various sizes and colors, blurred to create a smooth gradient effect.  
3. **Interaction Display**: Inspired by Mobrilon's artwork, this layout highlights the interaction between colors.  
4. **Hexadecimal Codes**: A simple presentation displaying the hexadecimal color codes for easy reference.  

### Export Feature  
On the final page, users can download a CSV file containing detailed information about the generated colors, including:  
- Conceptual values.  
- Color values (hex codes).  

We hope you enjoy exploring and creating with **I MAK'OLOR**!
